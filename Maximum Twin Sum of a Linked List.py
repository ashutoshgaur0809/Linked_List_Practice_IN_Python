# Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation:
# Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
# There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
# Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. 
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
# Output: 7
# Explanation:
# The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
# - Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
# - Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
# Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7. 
# Example 3:


# Input: head = [1,100000]
# Output: 100001
# Explanation:
# There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.
